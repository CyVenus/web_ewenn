# Rive contract

The single source of truth for how this site talks to the Rive scene. If anything else in the
repo disagrees about names, inputs or fit mode, **this document wins**.

These names are referenced as literal strings in `src/config.ts` and `src/components/RiveScene.tsx`.
A mismatch does not throw. The scene keeps animating and silently stops responding to the clock,
which is the failure mode every rule below exists to prevent.

- **File:** `assets/rive/ewenn-scene.riv`, exported from the Rive editor file `scene-singlesection`
  (file id 2569346). Served at `/rive/ewenn-scene.riv`.
- **Runtime:** `@rive-app/react-webgl2`. The Rive Renderer is **required**, not a preference: the
  near snowflakes are feathered and the snowfall is drawn by an embedded Luau script. The
  `react-canvas`, `canvas-lite` and `webgl` runtimes either drop the effect or cannot run the file.
- Re-exporting? Run `npm run sync:assets`, then `npm run screenshots`.

## Artboards

| Artboard | Used when | Design size |
|---|---|---|
| `site-desktop` | `innerWidth / innerHeight >= 0.75` | 2243 × 1205 |
| `site-mobile` | `innerWidth / innerHeight < 0.75` | 1080 × 2340 |

Both use state machine **`State Machine 1`** and bind view model **`PenguinControls`**, instance
**`Default`** — so the runtime is given `autoBind: true`.

Every other artboard in the file is a component nested inside these two. **Never load one
directly.** Layout is `new Layout({ fit: Fit.Layout })` at the default scale factor; both
artboards reflow correctly at every viewport shape in the screenshot matrix.

Switching artboard remounts the runtime (`useRive` reads its parameters only at mount), so the
resize that triggers it is debounced by 150 ms in `src/hooks/useViewportArtboard.ts`.

## What the site writes — and it is only these three

| Property | Type | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `time` | number | `0` night, `1` day, `2` noon, `3` evening. Entry transitions are 0 ms, so a value written in `onRiveReady` lands on frame 1. Later changes blend over 500 ms. |
| `lampOn` | trigger | Fire when the phase becomes evening or night, and once shortly after load if it starts in one. Idempotent. |
| `lampOff` | trigger | Fire when the phase becomes day or noon. Idempotent. |

Written imperatively: `rive.viewModelInstance.number('time').value = n` and
`rive.viewModelInstance.trigger('lampOn').trigger()`. No `useStateMachineInput`, no Rive Events.

Because both triggers are idempotent, the lamp is **reasserted on every phase change** rather
than only on transitions into evening. `src/components/RiveScene.test.tsx` locks that in.

## What the site must never touch

`vw`, `vh`, `section`, `nav` and everything under it, every `navTest*`, `tap`, `jump`,
`lampTapped`, `snow`, `flagTapped`, `goalCompleted`, `appStoreClicked`, `playStoreClicked`,
`hoverAppStore`, `hoverPlayStore`, `treeTapFrontLeft`, `treeTapFrontRight`, `treeTapBackLeft`,
`treeTapBackLeft2`, `treeTapBackRight`.

Some are inert leftovers from an earlier multi-section site. The rest belong to interactions that
run **inside** the file and need no site code.

## Interactions that live in the .riv

The site contributes no click handling whatsoever. There is not one pointer event listener in
`src/`.

- **Penguin** — pointer down makes it jump; otherwise it cycles random idle animations.
- **Streetlamp** — a click toggles the light.
- **Trees** — pointer down shakes the tapped tree (root bone about ±4.7°, settling in ~0.8 s) and
  drops nine snow clumps that fade within ~1 s. Five trees on `site-desktop`, two on
  `site-mobile`; each placement has its own view-model instance, so only the tapped one reacts.
  Tapping mid-shake restarts the shake.
- **Snowfall** — the embedded `Snowfall` Luau script, on at load: 220 flakes in three parallax
  layers, the near layer feathered.
- **Clouds** drift continuously.

**This is why `.overlay` is `pointer-events: none`,** with `auto` restored only on its own links
and the footer pill. The trap that creates is worth stating: anything added to the HTML layer that
covers the lamp or a tree leaves them *clickable while invisible*. The landscape corridor in
`global.css` exists partly for that reason.

### Known defect

**The back-left tree does not respond to taps.** Inherited from the previous build and not yet
fixed in the editor. Do not work around it in site code — it is a hit-area problem in the `.riv`.

## Safe zones for the HTML layer

**`site-desktop`** at roughly 16:9 — the penguin is horizontally centred (47–56% of the width);
its head starts at ~58% of the viewport height and its feet end at ~75%. The sun is top-left by
day, top-centre at noon and on the right in the evening; the moon is top-left at night. On aspect
ratios ≥ 2:1 or heights ≤ 500 px the bottom-anchored scene raises the penguin to 45–51%, which is
what the landscape corridor in `global.css` is for.

**`site-mobile`** (portrait) — sun and moon top-right (5–10% of the height), leaving the header
clear on the left. Tree tops reach ~48%. On phones the penguin's head starts at ~59% and its feet
end at ~77%; on iPad portrait, ~66% and ~86%. Plain snow fills from ~80% down, where the footer sits.

## Phase colours

Sky base fill per phase: day `#81CBEE`, noon `#9BDEFE`, evening `#F2AD71`, night `#867BFB`.
Mirrored in `src/lib/phase.ts` as `PHASE_SKY`, which also feeds `<meta name="theme-color">` and
the static fallback sky.

Only the sky, the sun and the moon change with the phase. **The ground art has no night variant**,
so night is where header and footer legibility is tightest — `npm run contrast` measures it.
