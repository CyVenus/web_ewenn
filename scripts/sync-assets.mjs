/**
 * Copies the protected source artwork in `assets/` to the places the app actually loads it from,
 * and verifies the copies byte-for-byte.
 *
 * `assets/` holds the originals: the Rive export and the two SVGs, none of which this project
 * generates. They are needed in two other shapes — `public/` for files served by URL at runtime
 * (the `.riv` is fetched by the runtime, the favicon by the browser) and `src/assets/` for files
 * Vite fingerprints into the bundle. Nothing derives one from the other, so before this script
 * the logo existed three times and the `.riv` twice with no way to notice a re-export landing in
 * one place and not the others. A stale `.riv` is the expensive one: the site would keep running
 * and quietly draw the previous scene.
 *
 *   node scripts/sync-assets.mjs         # copy, then verify
 *   node scripts/sync-assets.mjs --check # verify only; non-zero exit if anything drifted
